			TEXT CLASSIFICATION INTO AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF CATEGORIES

# OBJECTIVE
This study aims to classify research articles, based on their abstract, into ùëÅ meaningful categories. Subject category labels are provided, but the purpose of this project is to go beyond the original labelling to find a better category representation. The obtained classes should of course contain information about the original subject categories. The optimal number of categories ùëÅ is unknown and finding its best value is one of the main challenges of the project. To this end, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline is developed by using Python language. 

# DATASET
The employed dataset is the open source arXiv Dataset (available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv). This is rich corpus of about 2 M articles, including publication information such as article titles, authors, subject categories, and abstracts. For computational reasons, in this project only a subset of the corpus has been used

# FOLDER CONTENT

- requirements.txt in which the necessary Python package are reported;
- run.sh in which an example of how to run the whole pipeline in shown;
- Python files performing the NLP pipeline.
